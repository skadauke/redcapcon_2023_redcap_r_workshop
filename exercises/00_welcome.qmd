## Quarto

Quarto (the successor of "R Markdown") enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.

You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

The following code chunk will connect to a REDCap database and download its data into an object called `my_redcap_data`. Run the code chunk.

```{r}
library(REDCapR)

redcap_uri <- "https://redcap.chop.edu/api/"

## TODO: use a secure creds file instead of hardcoding this
token <- "37BCFC38D45F10C47EAF4D8B97BFC32F"

## TODO: Right now this has lots of empty rows. Come up with a better solution. Maybe download from a different, simpler database?
my_redcap_data <- redcap_read_oneshot(redcap_uri, token, forms = "demographics")$data
```
