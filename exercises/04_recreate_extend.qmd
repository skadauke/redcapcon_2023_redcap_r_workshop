## Recreate

In this section, your challenge is to work with your small group to recreate the object shown below. This is a tibble with three columns derived from the `demographics` table. Use the empty code chunk to write the code to recreate this tibble.

![](recreate_tbl.png){width="494"}

```{r}
# Your code here!

library(REDCapR)

creds <- retrieve_credential_local("../data-private/credentials.csv", 1)

uri <- creds$redcap_uri
token <- creds$token

redcart <- read_redcap(uri, token)

redcart |>
  extract_tibble("demographics") |>
  select(infseq_id, demo_last_name, demo_birth_date)
```

## Extend

The purpose of the *Extend* part is for you to explore what you've learned on your own and try to take it a step further as a group.

For example, you might want to embellish the visualization from the previous exercise. Or you might want to look up the [REDCapTidieR documentation](https://chop-cgtinformatics.github.io/REDCapTidieR/reference/index.html) and try out some of its other functions such as `make_labelled()` or `write_redcap_xlsx()`.

After the time is over, each group will briefly present what they've worked on.

Use the empty code chunk below!

```{r}
# Your code here! :)


```
