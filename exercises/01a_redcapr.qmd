## Extracting Data from REDCap using REDCapR

For the first 10 min, we will download data using [REDCapR](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR).
Let's install with the newest version of REDCapR from GitHub.

```{r}
if (packageVersion("REDCapR") < "1.1.9005") {
  install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github("OuhscBbmc/REDCapR")
}
```

### Retrieve Secure Token

We'll discuss tokens in more depth at the end of the workshop. For now, know that a "token" is a secret value that serves as your personal password to a specific REDCap project.
We'll retrieve it from a file stored in a (pretend) secured directory.

<!-- path_credential <- "redcapcon_2023_redcap_r_workshop/data-private/credentials.csv" -->
```{r}
path_credential <- "../data-private/credentials.csv"
credential      <- REDCapR::retrieve_credential_local(path_credential, 1L)
credential
```

### Peek at Variables, Events, & Instruments

Stephan created fake data that mimics the real CAR-T investigation.
The first snippet reveals info from the 368 variables.
The second reveals info about the combinations of events & instruments.

```{r}
REDCapR::redcap_metadata_read(
  redcap_uri  = credential$redcap_uri,
  token       = credential$token
)$data

REDCapR::redcap_event_instruments(
  redcap_uri  = credential$redcap_uri,
  token       = credential$token
)$data
```

If important details are obscured, use `View()` to see things in a nice scrollable table inside RStudio:

```r 
View(
  REDCapR::redcap_metadata_read( 
    credential$redcap_uri, 
    credential$token 
  )$data
)
```
